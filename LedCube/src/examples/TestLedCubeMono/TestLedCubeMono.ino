/**
 * Test application for LedCubeMono library. This application waits from individual
 * frames on serial line at 4800 bauds. Each frame is supposed to be sent as raw byte sequence
 * (e.g. for a 4x4x4 cube, 8 bytes are sent, each couple of bytes representing a layer, ordered from
 * bottom to top). Each frame is acknowledged with a single byte, and displayed once
 * (with a default frame rate of 50 FPS). If no other frame is received, the current frame is displayed
 * again.
